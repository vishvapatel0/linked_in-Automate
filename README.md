üîå API Integrations
RapidAPI - Fresh LinkedIn Profile Data
Used to extract detailed profile information from LinkedIn URLs.

Python
def _get_profile_from_rapidapi(self, linkedin_url):
    """Get LinkedIn profile data using the Fresh LinkedIn Profile Data API."""
    if not RAPIDAPI_KEY:
        print("No RapidAPI key provided")
        return None
    
    api_url = "https://fresh-linkedin-profile-data.p.rapidapi.com/get-linkedin-profile"
    
    querystring = {"linkedin_url": linkedin_url}
    
    headers = {
        "X-RapidAPI-Key": RAPIDAPI_KEY,
        "X-RapidAPI-Host": "fresh-linkedin-profile-data.p.rapidapi.com"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return self._format_profile_data(data, linkedin_url)
        else:
            print(f"RapidAPI request failed: Status code {response.status_code}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"RapidAPI request error: {e}")
        return None
Serper API
Used for high-quality search results to find LinkedIn profiles.

Python
def extract_linkedin_urls_from_serp(search_query, num_results=10):
    """Use Serper API to find LinkedIn profiles."""
    if not SERP_API_KEY:
        print("No Serper API key provided")
        return []
    
    url = "https://google.serper.dev/search"
    
    payload = json.dumps({
        "q": f"site:linkedin.com/in/ {search_query}",
        "num": num_results
    })
    
    headers = {
        'X-API-KEY': SERP_API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            
            linkedin_urls = []
            
            # Process organic results
            if "organic" in data:
                for result in data["organic"]:
                    link = result.get("link", "")
                    if "linkedin.com/in/" in link:
                        clean_url = link.split('?')[0]  # Remove query parameters
                        linkedin_urls.append(clean_url)
            
            return linkedin_urls[:num_results]
        else:
            print(f"Serper API request failed: {response.status_code}")
            return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error using Serper API: {e}")
        return []
‚ùó Troubleshooting
Common Issues
No Candidates Found

Problem: The agent returns zero candidates.
Solutions:
Check that your API keys are valid and properly configured in .env
Ensure your job description contains clear skills and requirements
Try using a more general job title or fewer specific requirements
Run with --verbose flag to see detailed debugging information
Poor Quality Candidates

Problem: The candidates don't match the job requirements well.
Solutions:
Improve the job description with more specific requirements
Adjust the scoring thresholds in _score_candidate method
Add more relevant skills and keywords to the job description
API Rate Limiting

Problem: You hit API rate limits during execution.
Solutions:
Reduce the --max parameter value
Implement a delay between API calls
Use a premium API plan with higher limits
Slow Performance

Problem: The agent takes too long to complete.
Solutions:
Use Serper API instead of Google search (--serper flag)
Reduce the number of candidates to process
Cache results for reuse in future runs
üí° Best Practices
Job Descriptions: Provide detailed and specific job descriptions for better results.
API Keys: Keep your API keys secure in the .env file and never commit them to version control.
Rate Limits: Be mindful of API rate limits, especially for the LinkedIn Profile Data API.
Customization: The scoring algorithm can be customized in the _score_candidate method to match your specific requirements.
Data Storage: Regularly clean up the data directory to manage disk space.
Testing: Start with a small number of candidates to test before running larger searches.
üîÆ Future Enhancements
Implement parallel processing for faster profile extraction
Add support for multiple job descriptions in a single run
Develop a web interface for easier interaction
Incorporate machine learning for better candidate matching
Add integration with email systems for automated outreach
Support for other professional networks beyond LinkedIn
Implementation of A/B testing for outreach messages
